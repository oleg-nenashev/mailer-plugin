GitHub Actions demo for the Mailer plugin and ci.jenkins.io-runner
=========================================

This branch demonstrates some GitHub actions for building Jenkins plugins with [Jenkinsfile Runner](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner) o GitHub actions.

This demo uses the [ci.jenkins.io-runner GitHub Action](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/ci.jenkins.io-runner-action) that packages [ci.jenkins.io-runner](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ci.jenkins.io-runner) as a GitHub Action.
